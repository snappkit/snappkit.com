### Hey, I'm Ross 👋

I'm a developer and founder based in Wellington, NZ. Currently building [SnappKit](https://snappkit.com) — a screenshot API for developers.

#### 🖼️ What I'm working on

**[SnappKit](https://snappkit.com)** — Screenshot API with sub-2s response times, 99.9% uptime, and zero browser infrastructure to manage.

The problem I'm solving: Developers waste weeks setting up Puppeteer clusters, fighting memory leaks, and debugging timeout errors. SnappKit handles it all with one API call.
```bash
curl -X POST https://snappkit.com/api/screenshot \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"url": "https://github.com"}'
```
