### Hey, I'm Ross 👋

I'm building [SnappKit](https://snappkit.com) — a screenshot API for developers who are tired of managing Puppeteer clusters.

**What I'm working on:**
- 🖼️ [SnappKit](https://snappkit.com) — Screenshot API with <2s response times
- 📝 Writing about developer tools and bootstrapping

**The problem I'm solving:**
Developers waste weeks setting up headless browsers, fighting memory leaks, and debugging timeout errors. SnappKit handles it all with a single API call.
```bash
curl -X POST https://snappkit.com/api/screenshot \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"url": "https://github.com"}'
```

SnappKit is a screenshot API built for developers who need reliable image generation without the infrastructure headaches.

Why developers choose SnappKit:
→ 5-minute integration (not 5 weeks)

**Headline:**
```
Founder of SnappKit
```

**Bio:**
```
I build tools for developers. Currently working on SnappKit — a screenshot API that lets you capture websites and render HTML without managing headless browser infrastructure.

The idea came from watching developers waste weeks setting up Puppeteer clusters, only to fight memory leaks and timeout errors forever. SnappKit handles all of that with a single API call.

What SnappKit does:
- Screenshots from any URL in <2 seconds
- HTML-to-image rendering (perfect for OG images)
- 99.9% uptime, zero infrastructure to manage
- 200 free credits to get started

If you're building something that needs screenshots, I'd love to chat.
